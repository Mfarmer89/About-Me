  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>Lab 02</h2>

  <p>As a student in training im creating an about me page to practice my coding and to introduce myself.
    My name is Ricardo Collymore and i want to, one day be a game designer.</p> 
    <p>I grew up playing them and making them
  (with
  pre-prepared tools) and now i want to learn how to make them from scratch.<p> I use to play in gaming tournements
    before becoming a coding student. I also did alot of graphic design and animation a few years back. </P>

  <p> Im definitely more of the silent type, the only thing that comes close to my love of games and art is my love of
    peace and quiet. I like studying mythologies. (Greek, Norse and Ejyptian in particular) I made it a habbit to use
    unknown mythological figures such as Yudi, Nǚwā, Onida ect as usernames on different platforms just to have people
    scratching their heads.</p>
